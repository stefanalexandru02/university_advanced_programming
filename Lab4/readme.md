# The Student-Project Allocation Problem
An instance of this problem consists of students and projects. Each student has a list of projects that are admissible.
A matching is a set of pairs (student, project) such that each student is assigned to at most one project and each project is assigned to at most one student. We consider the problem of creating a maximum cardinality matching between students and projects.

Example: 3 students (S0,S1,S2) and 3 projects (P0,P1,P2).
Projects considered admissible by: S0={P0,P1,P2}, S1={P0,P1}, S2={P0}.
The maximum cardinality matching should be: {S0-P2, S1-P1, S2-P0}.

# Compulsory

Two new classes were created, Student and Project. Both of them contain name variables, with getter and setters.
Student class also contains a list of admissible projects.
Inside the main class we generate two lists, one for students one for projects using stream class.
